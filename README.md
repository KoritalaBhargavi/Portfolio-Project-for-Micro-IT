## üìä My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

-   **Netflix Data Analysis Using Tableau:** This Tableau project focuses on analyzing the Netflix dataset to provide insights into the distribution of content (movies and TV shows) by country, genre, ratings, and more. The dashboard was built as part of a data visualization internship task to demonstrate storytelling using interactive visualizations.

-   **Urban Heat Islands Analysis Using GIS and Statistical models:** Urban Heat Island (UHI) analysis using GIS and statistical models investigates the phenomenon where urban areas experience significantly higher temperatures than their surrounding rural counterparts. GIS plays a crucial role in visualizing and analyzing spatial data such as land surface temperature (derived from satellite imagery), land cover, and urban infrastructure.
